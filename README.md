# React

React is a test project to learn... yeah, the basics [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/).
Why? Because I need it for my work. And also it is a great piece of technology.

So, let's go!

## What is React?

- Open sourse projected, maintained by Facebook
- Can be the "V" in MVC
- Ideal for large-scale, single page application (SPA)
- Uses high-speed virtual DOM
- Uses clean and easy-to-understand JSX syntax

## Why is React so fast?

- JS objects are faster than DOM objects
- The React virtual DOM is a JS object
- React never reads from the “real” DOM
- React only writes to the real DOM if needed
- React efficiently handles DOM updates

## What is JSX?

- JSX stands for JavaScript as XML
- It allows us to use a very XML-like syntax in our JavaScript
- JSX syntax needs to be converted to plain JavaScript before it will run in the browser
- Tool for this called [Babel](https://babeljs.io)
